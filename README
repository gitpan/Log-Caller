NAME
    Log::Caller

SYNOPSIS
     log_debug "scanning new data...";
     [debug] scanning new data...  at t/00compile.t line 6

     log_warn "client %d not found!",$id;

DESCRIPTION
     There are scores of loggers out there, of varying usefulness, yet I still find myself and others constantly putting 
     warn "blah" everywhere in the code. Why? 
     a) because we're lazy, and it's the lowest effort form of logging output for debugging.
     b) the call stack is appended nicely
     c) because loggers can get huge and crufty
     I wanted something that would work like warn but be filterable with proper log levels, so I ended up here.
